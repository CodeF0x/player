Violin is a minimalistic and fast music player for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

If you just want to open a folder with your music and start listening instead of importing your songs to Spotify, downloading a huge app that's just overkill for your needs, or your songs are not on streaming platforms, Violin is for you. If that's not the case, you probably won't like Violin.
